        longDescription: "I have been working on the Red Padel app for almost a year now, contributing to the digitalization of the entire logistics experience of Padel in the USA. As the app continues to grow, with new users joining in for each tournament, the company is even closer to partnering with the USPA. My role in the team is officially a front-end developer, but I'm really versatile, so I usually do more than just staying in one lane My day-to-day involves using agile methodologies, such as having daily meetings and using JIRA and Bitbucket. I receive tickets, estimate time, leave comments, and do everything in between. Throughout my time working on the app, I have taken on various tasks, including solving countless bugs and developing full screens using Tailwind CSS and Vue 3. Most of those pages have dynamic rendering and multiple API connections. I used ApolloClient to consume GQL APIs from the front end, ensuring that changes made in the CMS were reflected automatically in the UI without the need for a refresh, demonstrating a commitment to reactivity principles. Additionally, I wrote e2e tests in Cypress for all the app's core features and implemented many test functionalities in Node.js to reduce the testing time.",
