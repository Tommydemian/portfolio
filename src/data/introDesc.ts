export const introDesc = "While my current role is as a front-end developer, I have also been writing Node.js for the past few months, which has given me full-stack experience. With a passion for problem solving and a background in psychology. I approach web development as an art form, using my my ability to think abstractly and quick learning ability to create intuitive and user-friendly websites. As i said before my experience extends beyond front-end development and includes expertise in e2e Cypress testing and Node.js. One of my proudest achievements was drastically reducing test execution time by understanding the double processing concept in Cypress and migrating functionalities directly in Node.js. I'm eager to apply my problem-solving and quick learning skills to web development and am actively seeking opportunities to do so."
